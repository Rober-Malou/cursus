# ‚úÖ Main Checklist

- [ x] Decide if you are going to do your project using chained lists or using tables
- [x ] Handle the arguments you are given in input
  - [ ] *(If you choose radix sort, normalize your data!)*

# ‚ùå Error Checklist

There are a lot of errors to handle in push_swap. Don't forget any of them!

- [ ] The program must work with several numerical arguments  
  ```
  ./push_swap 1 3 5 +9 20 -4 50 60 04 08
  ```
- [ ] The program also works if you receive a single character list as a parameter  
  ```
  ./push_swap "3 4 6 8 9 74 -56 +495"
  ```
- [ ] The program should **NOT** work if it encounters another character  
  ```
  ./push_swap 1 3 dog 35 80 -3
  ./push_swap a
  ./push_swap 1 2 3 5 67b778 947
  ./push_swap " 12 4 6 8 54fhd 4354"
  ./push_swap 1 -- 45 32
  ```
  ‚úÖ These examples should return **"Error\n"**

- [ ] The program should **NOT** work if it encounters a double number  
  ```
  ./push_swap 1 3 58 9 3
  ./push_swap 3 03
  ./push_swap " 49 128     50 38   49"
  ```
  ‚úÖ These examples should return **"Error\n"**

- [ ] The following example **should work** because `-9` & `9` are **not equal**
  ```
  ./push_swap "95 99 -9 10 9"
  ```

- [ ] The program should work with **INT MAX & INT MIN**
  ```
  ./push_swap 2147483647 2 4 7
  ./push_swap 99 -2147483648 23 545
  ./push_swap "2147483647 843 56544 24394"
  ```
  ‚úÖ These examples should **work and sort your list**

- [ ] The program should **NOT** work if numbers exceed INT MAX/MIN  
  ```
  ./push_swap 54867543867438 3
  ./push_swap -2147483647765 4 5
  ./push_swap "214748364748385 28 47 29"
  ```
  ‚úÖ These examples should return **"Error\n"**

- [ ] Nothing has been specified when strings and integers are mixed. It's up to you what you want to do  
  ```
  ./push_swap "1 2 4 3" 76 90 "348 05
  ```

# ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions Checklist

This checklist will help you verify that you have coded all the **instructions (11)** to use them in your algorithms.  

- [ ] `sa` (swap a): If there are 2 numbers, swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack `a`
- [ ] `sb` (swap b): If there are 2 numbers, swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack `b`
- [ ] `ss`: `sa` and `sb` at the same time
- [ ] `pa` (push a): If `b` is not empty, take the first element on top of `b` and put it on `a`
- [ ] `pb` (push b): If `a` is not empty, take the first element on top of `a` and put it on `b`
- [ ] `ra` (rotate a): Shift all the elements of stack `a` up by one position. The first element becomes the last
- [ ] `rb` (rotate b): Shift all the elements of stack `b` up by one position. The first element becomes the last
- [ ] `rr`: `ra` and `rb` at the same time
- [ ] `rra` (reverse rotate a): Shift all elements of stack `a` down one position. The last element becomes the first
- [ ] `rrb` (reverse rotate b): Shift all elements of stack `b` down one position. The last element becomes the first
- [ ] `rrr`: `rra` and `rrb` at the same time

# üî¢ Algorithm/Sort Checklist

- [ ] Check if the order of the list is correct or if it should be sorted
- [ ] Make a small algorithm for small numbers (5 and less)
  - [ ] Implement a condition for **2 numbers**
  - [ ] Create an algorithm for **3 numbers**
  - [ ] Create an algorithm for **4 numbers**
  - [ ] Create an algorithm for **5 numbers**
- [ ] Create another algorithm for all other numbers
